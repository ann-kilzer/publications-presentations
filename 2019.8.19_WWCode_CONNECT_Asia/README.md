# Blockchain Build-along: Decentralized Game Development

Women Who Code CONNECT Asia
Singapore, August 31, 2019

I developed a blockchain based game based on a Japanese treasure hunt known as a “Stamp Rally”. I broke down the exercise into a workshop where participants built key parts of the app in Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org), a browser-based solidity editor. I set up a frontend running on a public server, so participants could see how their work will fit into the larger context of decentralized application (DApp) development. I also ran this workshop for Tokyo and NYC networks of Women Who Code in August and October of 2019.
