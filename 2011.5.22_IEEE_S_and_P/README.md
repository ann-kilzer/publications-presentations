## Abstract

Many commercial websites use recommender systems to help customers locate products and content. Modern
recommenders are based on collaborative filtering: they use
patterns learned from users’ behavior to make recommendations,
usually in the form of related-items lists. The scale and complexity
of these systems, along with the fact that their outputs reveal only
relationships between items (as opposed to information about
users), may suggest that they pose no meaningful privacy risk.
In this paper, we develop algorithms which take a moderate
amount of auxiliary information about a customer and infer this
customer’s transactions from temporal changes in the public
outputs of a recommender system. Our inference attacks are
passive and can be carried out by any Internet user. We evaluate
their feasibility using public data from popular websites Hunch,
Last.fm, LibraryThing, and Amazon.
